IES-Ready Power Forecasting Dashboard (Demo)
Overview

This repository showcases an IES-aligned analytics capability for utility-scale solar power forecasting.
It demonstrates how high-frequency forecasts, multiple intraday revisions, and forecast-vs-actual analysis can support future aggregation and settlement workflows under the India Energy Stack (IES).

This is an analytics demonstration, not a live system.

What This Demo Shows

Power forecasting using satellite weather data

Up to 8 intraday forecast revisions

Forecast vs actual power comparison

Time-block aligned (15-min / hourly) analytics

Aggregated and plant-level views built in Grafana

These capabilities are foundational for:

Scheduling discipline

Aggregation of generation or demand

Settlement and deviation analysis

What This Demo Does NOT Show

No live APIs or system integrations

No real plant names, capacities, or locations

No grid operations, billing, or transactions

No exposure of internal or VPN-only systems

All visuals are masked or synthetic.

Summary

This demo shows that the forecasting and analytics foundation required for IES participation already exists.
Future work will focus on exposing these capabilities via standardized APIs as regulatory and commercial frameworks evolve.
